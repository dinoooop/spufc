From a large playful roof top terrace known as the Candy Bar, head down into the heart of the building for some time on the dancefloor that surrounds the central tiered jungle. Further down, there’s also an outdoor beer and wine garden right on the Beaufort Street strip. ",

    description: 'The South Perth United Football Club was formed in 1981 with an initial membership of just 20 members. From our humble beginnings, we have grown in line with the phenomenal growth in the popularity of the sport of soccer itself in Australia. In fact, the growth in the club’s player membership has even accelerated over the last five years, where membership approaches 250 including seniors and juniors.',
